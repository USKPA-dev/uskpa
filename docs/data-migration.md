## Migrating the Legacy USKPA data
[:arrow_left: Back to USKPA
Documentation](../docs)

### Legacy USKPA database

The legacy data is contained within an MS SQL 2012 database.


### Migration

The legacy data migration has 4 primary components, executed in order.

1. Extract data from MS SQL 2012
2. Prepare extracted data for processing
3. Transform prepared data to match new data model
4. Import data to postgres database


#### Data Extraction

Selected tables from the legacy database shall be exported to a CSV file.

Tables utilized in migration:
 - tblCertificate
 - tblCountries
 - tblState
 - tblLicensee
 - tlbDeliveryStatus
 - tblHCDCodes
 - tblPortOfExport

#### Data Preparation

The address fields within the exported `tblCertificates.csv` file contain `\n` characters without surrounding field qualifiers. This corrupts the expected CSV format by having certificate records which span lines leading to truncated and otherwise unexpected data upon import.

To remediate this file, regular expressions are used to identify and replace the offending `\n` characters with `|`. These character replacements will be reverted prior to final import to the new database.

#### Data Transformation

Transformations performed upon incoming Certificate data fields.

##### Status
  - If no incoming status and `VoidCert==True`, set status to `Certificate.VOID`
  - If no incoming status and `VoidCert not True`, set status to `Certificate.AVAILABLE`
  - Otherwise, map incoming status to `Certificate.SHIPPED` or `Certificate.DELIVERED`

##### Licensee
  - Certificates excluded if `LicenseeID == 17 (TEST)`
  - Licensee set to `None` if LicenseeID not found in `tblLicensee`

##### AES
 - Convert `x` to `X`
 - If value is 14 digits, prepend with `X`.
 - Imported as-is, even if AES format validation fails.

##### Port of Export
  - Values modified to be consistent w/ those present in `tblPortOfExport`
  - Converted to a ForeignKey relationship

##### ImporterCountry
  - Values modified to conform to latest ISO-3166 short-names.

##### Consignee Address
  - Insert `ImporterCountry` at end of address, if not already present

#### Data Import

The final data import, and overall orchestration of the migration process is handled via Django management commands.

The data migration should only be executed on a new database which has no `Licensee` or `Certificate` records.  However, the empty database does need to exist.  Refer to the instructions on [local development](../docs/local-development.md)


Steps to migrate data:

1. Copy exported CSV files into a directory, `./data`, in the same folder as `manage.py`
2. Load initial data:
    ```
    docker-compose run app python manage.py loaddata initial_data
    ```
3. Import Licensee data:
    ```
    docker-compose run app python manage.py load_licensees ./data/tblLicensee.csv
    ```
4. Import Certificate data:
    ```
    docker-compose run app python manage.py load_certs ./data/tblCertificate.csv
    ```

Output contains summary information and any warning messages generated by the processing indicating unhandled or otherwise suspicious values.  This output can be written to a file by appending `> outputfilenam`  to the above commands.
